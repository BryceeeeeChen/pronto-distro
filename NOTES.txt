Software Layout: 

when standalone:
externals        - modules shared with drc but common projects (branched)
kinematics-utils - mostly ports from ROS of urdf & kinematics tools (kdl_parser, orocos_kdl, urdf, urdf_dom)
pronto           - the state estimator and related utils

In part of drc codebase:
externals        - remains as was
kinematics-utils - now part of ~/drc/software/externals
pronto           - located in ~/drc/software

1111111111111111111111 TODO 111111111111111111111111
For standlone, decide how to get externals.
could get at 1) check out 2) build 3) additional command

1) doesnt happen without submodule init, doesnt support tarball and svn
2) (as in externals) I don't like this
3) "make checkout"


22222222222222 TODO for release (code level) 222222222222222222222222222222
merge pronto and mav types
re-organise mav
extract lcm from mav

remove necessaity for all the atlas feedback types:
- only required for laser to be turned on and off
- have the behaviour bit published by a different and simpler message
- also have the feedback messages not published when in user mode
- for old logs, write a python converter that will republish the behavior bit to the new type

opencv -------------------------------------------------
required by occ-map, can i remove it?


To provide to others:
- a script that launches
-- lcm-playback
-- ui
-- fusion

- cfg files 

A sketch of a translator for ros-to-lcm




================= OLD NOTES =================
AAAAAAAAAA OTHER MODULES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
kinematics, robot_model, pronto-utils
isam_include and visualization
Source:
MOVED TO PRONTO_EXTERNALS kinematics - move to externals, make a git-pod
MOVED TO PRONTO_EXTERNALS robot_model - move to externals, except gfe_renderer, remove the urdf lcmtype from drc, remove the concise args dependency
MOVED TO PRONTO_EXTERNALS pointcloud-utils - rename to pronto-utils and move to externals, make a git-pod. remove lcmtypes. dependencies: pcl, Eigen, bot_core, visualization pod, isam
MERGED TO PRONTO_UTILS JointUtils - stores the joint name vector, branch this but retain the class as names of joints will change and will need new logic to easily switch
REMOVED DEP bot_frames_cpp - minimal usage of get_trans function, replace with bot_frames calls

CCCCCCCCCCCCC BUILDING ISSUE CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
on my machine i need to disable gpu in opencv:
make
ccmake pod-build
< disable opencv_gpu and CUDA >
make
